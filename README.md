# Neural Network-based Translation Tool

## Scope
This tool is developed as part of the course "Advance course on natural language processing" for the Master's Degree Echange Program at Keio University (Tokyo, Japan).

## Introduction
This tool uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api/), that is a translation tool based on a neural network model that uses machine learning to improve the quality of their translations. First, a set of sentences are obtained as part of the data creation process. After that, using the DeepL API, the sentences are translated from English to Spanish. Then, the translations are manually checked and marked as “Correctly translated” or “Incorrectly translated”, so that we are able to see the accuracy of the tool.

## Clone
You can clone the repository to your local machine with:
